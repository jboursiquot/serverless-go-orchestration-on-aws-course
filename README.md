# Serverless Go Orchestration on AWS

Soon after you decide to embrace serverless architectures you realize that there is a need to coordinate all of the components that make up these distributed applications and services. In this course you will stitch together a series of Lambda functions written in the Go programming language (golang) to build and orchestrate a fully functional and scalable serverless application while learning how to handle the deployment, logging, metric collection, and distributed tracing that help you effectively adopt the serverless way. In addition to picking up some Go, you will learn how to use technologies like AWS SAM CLI, API Gateway, CloudFormation, SQS, DynamoDB, X-Ray, and Step Functions to build, deploy, debug and manage your serverless applications.

## Course Outline

- Introduction: Serverless Orchestration on AWS
- Demo and walkthrough of the serverless app architecture
- Getting to know SAM: Serverless Application Model
- Hands On: Deploying your serverless stack

- Hands On: Additional exercices
- Q&A and Wrap-up

## Prerequisites
- Have an AWS account and the [awscli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured locally (the services we use will fit comfortably within the free tier AWS provides)
- Have Docker installed
- Have Go installed (either on your machine or running from Docker container)
- Use an editor/IDE with Go plugin installed (optional)
- Some familiarity with Go is helpful but not required
